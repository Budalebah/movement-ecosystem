These fees can be allocated towards various purposes based on each individual team's needs and financial model. Baptswap uses an automated market maker (AMM) model, where users can trade against a liquidity pool of two assets, rather than an order book of buy and sell orders. Liquidity providers can earn fees by depositing their tokens into the pool, and traders can swap any token pair supported by the protocol. Baptswap handles the price calculations and slippage adjustments automatically, making trading fast and simple.
